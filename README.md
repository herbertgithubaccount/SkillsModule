Skills Module: A MWSE library for Morrowind

For 16 years it was believed that custom skills in Morrowind were simply impossible to implement. But with MWSE+Lua, that has all changed. Skills Module is a library that completely recreates the skills mechanics, from UI elements to leveling up, allowing mods to implement their own fully featured skills into the game with just a few lines of code.
